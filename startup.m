m = 550; %g, quadcopter mass
g = 9.8; %m/s gravity

%frame is X shaped, symmetrical

% x is forward
% y is to the left
% z is upward

% roll angle (?) rotation around the x axis.
% pitch angle (?) rotation around the y axis.
% yaw angle (?) rotation around the z axis.

vrot_i is rotor angular velocity, 1-4
